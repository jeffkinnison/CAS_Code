Regular weighted ensemble simulation Python code was developed by H. Lee, Stanford. 
Bash script for multiple simultaneous simulations was developed by S. Ahn, Stanford. 
Resampling method is from E. Darve, Stanford and J. Izaguirre, University of Notre Dame. 
Enhanced sampling weighted ensemble simulation Python code was developed on top of regular weighted ensemble code by S. Ahn, Stanford.

Please see the TODO sections in we_main.py, we_execute.sh, we_simulations.sh to get started (e.g. edit main directories, etc.). Then edit the we_initial_values.txt and we_parameters.txt for your simulation. we_execute.sh is the script to submit to your cluster to run the weighted ensemble simulation.

Please report any bugs and questions/comments to sahn1@stanford.edu.
