### the above lines are input for the following weighted ensemble simulation parameters ###
main_directory
initial_configuration_directory

flag  # 0: new simulation. 1: restarting simulation from middle of simulation. 2: restarting simulation from middle of
        binning. 3: restarting simulation from middle of resampling.
balls_flag  # 0: create new balls at each step. 1: keep created balls.
resample_less_flag  # 0: off. 1: on. resample_less entails sorting walkers' weights in ascending order (rare walkers
                      first) and binning walkers that have some property (e.g. weight, some collective variable like
                      distance) with value less or greater than the threshold to the nearest existing ball.
less_or_greater_flag  # 0: criteria for binning walkers is if the walkers have some property less than the threshold.
                        1: criteria for binning walkers is if the walkers have some property greater than the threshold.
                        -1: if resample_less_flag = 0.
static_threshold_flag  # 0: off, then the lowest (less_or_greater_flag = 0) or highest (less_or_greater_flag = 1)
                         current value is set as the threshold for the next step. 1: on, initial threshold is kept
                         throughout the simulation.

threshold  # if some property of the walker has a value less or greater than the threshold, then it is binned to the
             nearest existing ball.
property  # property of the walker that is used when resample_less_flag = 1. this can be weight or some collective
            variable. if it's weight, then type -1. otherwise type the index of the collective variable, e.g. if
            there are 3 collective variables and you would like to keep track of the last one, type 2.
enhanced_sampling_flag  # 0: off. 1: sub-binning balls by standard deviation distance from center of ball. 2: . 3: .
num_balls_limit  # limit is set depending on the available memory. parameter needed in case the calculated max_num_balls
                   is greater or too much smaller than the limit.

radius  # radius can be changed in the middle of the simulation.
num_walkers  # num_walkers should be fixed.
num_cvs  # number of collective variables (num_cvs) should be fixed.
lower_bound  # lower bound value for the collective variables. set it to arbitrary value if collective variables have
               different units. this is only used to calculate the volume of the free energy landscape.
upper_bound  # upper bound value for the collective variables.

initial_step_num  # initial_step_num should be changed from 0 when restarting a simulation.
max_num_steps
num_occupied_balls  # num_occupied_balls should be changed when restarting a simulation. NOTE: when flag = 3, this
                      should be equal to the highest walker number inside the WE folder
first_walker  # only needed if flag = 1, otherwise 0
last_walker  # only needed if flag = 1, otherwise 0
