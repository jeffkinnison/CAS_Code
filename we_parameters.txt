### the above lines are input for the following weighted ensemble simulation parameters ###
main_directory
initial_configuration_directory
flag  # 0: new simulation. 1: restarting simulation from middle of simulation. 2: restarting simulation from middle of
        binning. 3: restarting simulation from middle of resampling.
balls_flag  # 0: create new balls at each step. 1: keep created balls.
resample_less_flag  # 0: off. 1: on. resample_less entails sorting walkers' weights in ascending order and binning
                      walkers with weights less than weight_threshold to the nearest existing ball.
weight_threshold  # if the walker's weight is less than the threshold, then it is binned to the nearest existing ball.
enhanced_sampling_flag  # 0: off. 1: sub-binning balls by standard deviation distance from center of ball. 2: . 3: .
num_balls_limit  # limit is set depending on the available memory. parameter needed in case the calculated max_num_balls
                   is greater or too much smaller than the limit.
radius  # radius can be changed in the middle of the simulation.
num_walkers  # num_walkers should be fixed.
num_cvs  # number of collective variables (num_cvs) should be fixed.
lower_bound  # lower bound value for the collective variables. set it to arbitrary value if collective variables have
               different units. this is only used to calculate the volume of the free energy landscape.
upper_bound  # upper bound value for the collective variables.
initial_step_num  # initial_step_num should be changed from 0 when restarting a simulation.
max_num_steps
num_occupied_balls  # num_occupied_balls should be changed when restarting a simulation. NOTE: when flag = 3, this
                      should be equal to the highest walker number inside the WE folder
first_walker  # only needed if flag = 1, otherwise 0
last_walker  # only needed if flag = 1, otherwise 0
